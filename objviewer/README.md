# OBJViewer

This is a craptastic OBJ file viewer based on a hacked up version of
the IMGUI example. In particular, it is missing useful build files, the
xcode project is pretty specific to my setup, so it will probably take
some work to get this to build, but I figured it was better to include 
it even though it's not packaged up nicely than to leave it out.

I need to make a cmakefile or something eventually. Pull requests are 
welcome. :)
